            <p>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a 2013 epic high fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson
                from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, based on the 1937
                novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. The sequel to 2012's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, it is the
                second instalment in The Hobbit trilogy, acting as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
                <br><br>

                The film follows the titular character Bilbo Baggins as he continues to accompany Thorin Oakenshield and
                his fellow dwarves on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Pursuing them are
                the vengeful orcs Azog the Defiler and his son Bolg, while Gandalf the Grey investigates the return of a
                long-forgotten evil force in the ruins of Dol Guldur. The ensemble cast includes Ian McKellen, Martin
                Freeman, Richard Armitage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace, Luke Evans, Ken Stott,
                James Nesbitt, and Orlando Bloom. <br><br>

                The films were shot simultaneously in 3D at a projection rate of 48 frames per second, with principal
                photography taking place around New Zealand and at Pinewood Studios. Additional filming took place
                throughout May 2013. <br><br>

                The Desolation of Smaug premiered in Los Angeles on 2 December 2013, and was then released on 12
                December in New Zealand and on 13 December in the United States, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film
                received mostly positive reviews and grossed over $959 million at the worldwide box office, making it
                the fourth highest-grossing film of 2013. The film received numerous accolades; at the 86th Academy
                Awards, it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. <br><br>

                After successfully crossing over (and under) the Misty Mountains, Thorin and Company must seek aid from
                a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest--without their Wizard. If they reach
                the human settlement of Lake-town it will be time for the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract
                with the dwarves. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and burglar Baggins must seek
                out the Secret Door that will give them access to the hoard of the dragon Smaug. And, where has Gandalf
                got off to? And what is his secret business to the south? <br><br>

                Travel back to Middle-earth and the trilogy that started it all to relive the greatest moments from the
                epic fantasy-adventure franchise. <br><br>

                The final instalment of the trilogy, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, was released in 2014.

            <!-- PLOT -->

            <br>
            <h1 class="header">plot</h1><br> <br>

            <p>
                Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield meet at the Prancing Pony, and Gandalf convinces Thorin to take back
                Erebor and the Lonely Mountain. Twelve months later, Thorin and his company are being pursued by Azog
                and his Orc party. They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skin-changer who can
                take the form of a bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him
                to marshal his forces for war. Azog then delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. The following
                day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech
                imprinted on an old ruin. This, and a prior request by Galadriel, urge him to investigate the tombs of
                the Nazgûl. He warns the company to remain on the path and leaves them. Upon entering the forest they
                lose their way and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo then sets about freeing the dwarves with the
                help of his recently acquired invisibility ring. He subsequently drops the Ring and first begins to
                understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it. <br><br>

                The remaining spiders are fended off by the Wood-elves led by Tauriel and Legolas. They also capture the
                Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king Thranduil. Thorin confronts the Elvenking about his neglect
                of the Dwarves of Erebor following Smaug's attack 60 years earlier and is consequently imprisoned with
                the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, arranges an escape using empty wine barrels that are
                sent downstream. While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and
                Kíli is wounded with a Morgul shaft. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but
                ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom
                when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but
                Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves; Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and Radagast
                go to investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl, which they find to be empty. <br><br>

                The company is smuggled into Esgaroth by a bargeman called Bard. Thorin promises the Master and the
                people of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure. It is then revealed that Bard is a descendant of
                the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Kíli is forced to
                remain behind, tended to by Fíli, Óin, and Bofur, as the remaining company receives a grand farewell.
                Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of Dol Guldur, while Radagast leaves to warn Galadriel of
                their discovery at the tombs of the Nazgûl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed
                by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers and defeats Gandalf and reveals himself as Sauron. <br><br>

                Thorin and his remaining company reach the Lonely Mountain, where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance.
                He is sent in to retrieve the Arkenstone, and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While
                conversing with Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of both the dwarves' plot to retake the gold and the
                return of Sauron. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, as he
                fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master and his
                conniving servant, Alfrid, in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party
                then infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched following the arrival
                of Tauriel and Legolas; Tauriel then tends to Kíli. While Kíli is recovering, he openly admires
                Tauriel's beauty and wonders if she loves him. Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf
                watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain. <br><br>

                Back inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using
                Smaug's flames to create and melt a large golden statue, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold.
                They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, stumbles out of the mountain and flies off to destroy
                Laketown as Bilbo watches in despair.<br><br>
