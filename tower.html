            <p>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a 2002 epic fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson
                from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair, and Jackson, based on 1954's The Two
                Towers, the second volume of the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The sequel to 2001's
                The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the film is the second instalment in The Lord of the
                Rings trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo
                Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Bernard Hill, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd,
                Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Karl Urban, and
                Andy Serkis. <br><br>

                Continuing the plot of the previous film, it intercuts three storylines. Frodo and Sam continue their
                journey towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, meeting and joined by Gollum, the ring's former keeper.
                Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli come to the war-torn nation of Rohan and are reunited with the resurrected
                Gandalf, before fighting against the legions of the treacherous wizard Saruman at the Battle of Helm's
                Deep. Merry and Pippin escape capture, meet Treebeard the Ent, and help to plan an attack on Isengard,
                fortress of Saruman. <br><br>

                The Two Towers was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited
                entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. It
                premiered on 5 December 2002 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, and was then released on 18
                December in the United States and on 19 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by both critics
                and audiences, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film
                genre. It received praise for its direction, action sequences, performances, musical score, and CGI,
                particularly for Gollum. It grossed over $936 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of
                2002 and the third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release, behind Titanic and
                Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.[4] Following subsequent reissues, it has, as of 2021, grossed
                over $947 million. <br>

                Like the other films in the trilogy, The Two Towers is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most
                influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 75th Academy Awards, it was
                nominated for six awards, including Best Picture, winning for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual
                Effects. <br><br>

                Sauron's forces increase. His allies grow. The Ringwraiths return in an even more frightening form.
                Saruman's army of Uruk Hai is ready to launch an assault against Aragorn and the people of Rohan. Yet,
                the Fellowship is broken and Boromir is dead. For the little hope that is left, Frodo and Sam march on
                into Mordor, unprotected. A number of new allies join with Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin and Merry.
                And they must defend Rohan and attack Isengard. Yet, while all this is going on, Sauron's troops mass
                toward the City of Gondor, for the War of the Ring is about to begin. <br><br>

            <br>
            <h1 class="header">plot</h1><br> <br>

            <p>Awakening from a dream of Gandalf fighting the Balrog in Moria, Frodo Baggins finds himself, along with
                Samwise Gamgee, lost in the Emyn Muil near Mordor. They discover that they are being tracked by Gollum,
                a former bearer of the One Ring. Capturing Gollum, Frodo takes pity and allows him to guide them,
                reminding Sam that they will need Gollum's help to infiltrate Mordor. <br><br>

                Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue a band of Uruk-hai to save their companions Merry and Pippin,
                entering the kingdom of Rohan. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by a group of Rohirrim, allowing Merry and
                Pippin to escape into Fangorn Forest. Meeting Aragorn's group, the Rohirrim's leader Éomer explains that
                he and his men have been exiled by Rohan's king, Théoden, who is under the control of Saruman and his
                servant Gríma Wormtongue. Éomer believes Merry and Pippin were killed during the raid but leaves the
                group two horses. In Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters Gandalf, who after his fight against the Balrog
                was resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save Middle-earth. <br><br>

                Gandalf leads the trio to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where Gandalf frees Théoden from Saruman's control.
                Aragorn stops Théoden from executing Wormtongue, who flees. Learning of Saruman's plans to destroy Rohan
                with his Uruk-hai army, Théoden evacuates his citizens to the fortress of The Hornburg at Helm's Deep.
                Gandalf departs to find Éomer and his followers, hoping they will fight for their restored king. Aragorn
                befriends Théoden's niece, Éowyn, who becomes infatuated with him. When the refugees travelling to
                Helm's Deep are attacked by Saruman's Warg-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls from a cliff and is presumed dead.
                He is found by Théodred's horse Brego and rides to Helm's Deep, witnessing Saruman's army marching to
                the fortress. <br><br>

                In Rivendell, Arwen is told by her father Elrond that Aragorn will not return. He reminds her that if
                she remains in Middle-earth, she will outlive Aragorn by thousands of years, and she reluctantly departs
                for Valinor. Elrond is contacted by Galadriel of Lothlórien, who convinces him that the Elves should
                honour their alliance to men, and they dispatch an army of Elves to Helm's Deep. <br><br>

                In Fangorn, Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, an Ent. Convincing Treebeard that they are allies, they are
                brought to an Ent Council, where the Ents decide not to take part in the coming war. Pippin asks
                Treebeard to take them in the direction of Isengard, where they witness the deforestation caused by
                Saruman's war effort. Enraged, Treebeard and the Ents storm Isengard, trapping Saruman in his tower.
                <br><br>

                Aragorn arrives at Helm's Deep, bringing word that Saruman's army is close and Théoden must prepare for
                battle despite being vastly outnumbered. The army of Elves from Lothlórien arrives, as does Saruman's
                army, and a battle ensues. The Uruk-hai breach the outer wall with explosives and during the ensuing
                charge kill the Elves' commander, Haldir. The defenders retreat into the keep, where Aragorn convinces
                Théoden to meet the Uruk-hai in one last charge. At dawn, as the defenders are overwhelmed, Gandalf and
                Éomer arrive with the Rohirrim, turning the tide of the battle. The surviving Uruk-hai flee into Fangorn
                Forest and are killed by the trees. Gandalf warns that Sauron will retaliate.<br><br>

                Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through the Dead Marshes to the Black Gate, but recommends they enter Mordor
                by another route. Frodo and Sam are captured by Rangers of Ithilien led by Faramir, younger brother of
                the late Boromir. Frodo helps Faramir catch Gollum to save him from being killed by the Rangers.
                Learning of the One Ring, Faramir takes his captives to Gondor to bring the ring to his father Denethor.
                Passing through the besieged city of Osgiliath, Frodo tries to explain to Faramir the true nature of the
                ring, and Sam explains that Boromir was driven mad by its power. A Nazgûl nearly captures Frodo, who
                falls under the ring's power, but Sam saves him and reminds him that they are fighting for the good
                still left in Middle-earth. Impressed by Frodo's resolve, Faramir releases them. Feeling betrayed,
                Gollum decides he will reclaim the Ring by leading Frodo to "Her" upon arriving at Cirith Ungol.</p>
