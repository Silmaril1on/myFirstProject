            <p>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a 2012 epic high fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson
                from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, based on the 1937
                novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is the first instalment in The Hobbit trilogy, acting as a
                prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br>
                The story is set in Middle-earth sixty years before the main events of The Lord of the Rings and
                portions of the film are adapted from the appendices to Tolkien's The Return of the King.[7] An
                Unexpected Journey tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard
                Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. The ensemble cast also includes Ken Stott,
                Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, James Nesbitt, Elijah Wood, and Andy Serkis,
                and features Sylvester McCoy, Barry Humphries, and Manu Bennett. <br>

                An Unexpected Journey premiered in Wellington on 28 November 2012, and was then released on 12 December
                in New Zealand and on 14 December in the United States, by 20th Century Fox. It was almost nine years
                after the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[8] The film received mixed reviews
                from critics and grossed over $1.017 billion at the box office, making it the fourth highest-grossing
                film of 2012. The film received numerous accolades; at the 86th Academy Awards, it was nominated for
                Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Visual Effects. <br>

                Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon
                Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company
                of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into
                the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders,
                Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely
                Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his
                life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming
                Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains
                possession of Gollum's "precious" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold
                ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know. <br><br>

                A film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit (1937) was in development for several years
                after the critical and financial success of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001 - 2003),
                co-written, co-produced, and directed by Peter Jackson. Jackson was initially going to produce and write
                a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, which was to be directed by Guillermo del Toro.[19] Del Toro left
                the project in May 2010, after about two years of working with Jackson and his production team, due to
                delays caused in part by financial problems at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[20] Jackson was announced as
                director that October.[20] The Hobbit films were produced back to back, like The Lord of the Rings
                films. Principal photography for The Hobbit films began on 21 March 2011 in New Zealand[21] and ended on
                6 July 2012, after 266 days of filming.[22] Pick-ups for An Unexpected Journey were filmed in July 2012
                as well.[23] Work on the film was expected to be completed on 26 November, just two days prior to the
                film's Wellington premiere. <br><br><br>

            <p>
                Approaching his 111th birthday, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins begins writing down the full story of his
                adventure 60 years earlier for the benefit of his nephew, Frodo. <br><br>

                Long before Bilbo's involvement, the Dwarf king Thrór brought an era of prosperity for his kin under the
                Lonely Mountain until the arrival of the dragon Smaug. Destroying the nearby town of Dale, Smaug drove
                the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thrór's grandson, Thorin, sees King
                Thranduil and his Wood-elves on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his
                people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of Elves.<br><br>

                In the Shire, 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a dinner for
                Thorin and his company of Dwarves: Balin, Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Dori, Nori, Ori, Óin, Glóin, Bifur, Bofur,
                and Bombur. Gandalf's aim is to recruit Bilbo as the company's "burglar" to aid them in their quest to
                enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the
                company leaves without him the next day. Bilbo races to join the company. Travelling onward, the company
                is captured by three Trolls. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes
                the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls' cave and finds treasure
                and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, Orcrist and Glamdring, respectively;
                Gandalf also finds an Elven dagger, which he gives to Bilbo.<br><br>

                The wizard Radagast the Brown finds Gandalf and the company, and recounts an encounter at Dol Guldur
                with the Necromancer, a sorcerer who has been corrupting Greenwood with dark magic. Chased by Orcs,
                Gandalf leads the company through a hidden passage to Rivendell. There, Lord Elrond discloses a hidden
                indication of a secret door on the company's map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on
                Durin's Day. Gandalf later approaches the White Council — consisting of Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman
                the White — and presents a Morgul blade, a weapon of the Witch-king of Angmar, which Radagast obtained
                from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of Sauron. While Saruman
                presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to
                it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward
                without him.<br><br>

                The company journeys into the Misty Mountains, where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between
                Stone Giants. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by Goblins, who take them to their leader, the
                Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters
                Gollum, who unknowingly drops a golden ring. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by
                Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by
                Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring
                is lost, Gollum realises that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants
                him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes
                while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.<br><br>

                Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost
                his forearm to Thorin in battle outside the Dwarven kingdom of Moria, has placed a bounty on Thorin's
                head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the
                mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by
                Azog and his hunting party, and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and
                severely injures him with his Warg. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs and challenges Azog, just as the
                company is rescued by eagles summoned by Gandalf. They escape to the safety of the Carrock where Gandalf
                revives Thorin, who renounces his previous disdain for Bilbo after being saved by him.<br><br>

                They see the Lonely Mountain in the distance, where the sleeping Smaug is awoken by a thrush knocking a
                snail against a stone.<br><br>
