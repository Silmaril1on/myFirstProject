                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (later
                    annexed by the
                    British Empire; now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa), to Arthur Reuel Tolkien
                    (1857-1896), an
                    English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870-1904). The couple had left England when
                    Arthur was promoted
                    to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling,
                    his younger brother,
                    Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894. <br><br>

                    As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to have
                    been later echoed
                    in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders
                    as an adult. In an
                    earlier incident from Tolkien's infancy, a young family servant took the baby to his homestead,
                    returning him the next
                    morning. <br><br>

                    When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a
                    lengthy family visit. His
                    father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them. This left the
                    family without an
                    income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon
                    after, in 1896, they
                    moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham.
                    He enjoyed
                    exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later
                    inspire scenes in his
                    books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places
                    such as his aunt
                    Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.<br><br>


                    Birmingham Oratory, where Tolkien was a parishioner and altar boy (1902-1911)
                    Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen
                    pupil. She taught
                    him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young
                    Tolkien liked to draw
                    landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother
                    taught him the rudiments
                    of Latin very early.<br><br>

                    Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed
                    him to read many
                    books. He disliked Treasure Island and "The Pied Piper" and thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
                    by Lewis Carroll
                    was "amusing but disturbing". He liked stories about "Red Indians" (Native Americans) and works of
                    fantasy by George
                    MacDonald. In addition, the "Fairy Books" of Andrew Lang were particularly important to him and
                    their influence is
                    apparent in some of his later writings.<br><br>

                    King Edward's School in Birmingham, where Tolkien was a pupil (1900-1902, 1903-1911)
                    Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her
                    Baptist family,
                    which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J. R. R. Tolkien was 12, his mother
                    died of acute diabetes
                    at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old
                    as a person with
                    diabetes mellitus type 1 could survive without treatment—insulin would not be discovered until 1921,
                    two decades later.
                    Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to
                    everybody that God
                    grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who
                    killed herself with
                    labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."
                    Before her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend,
                    Father Francis Xavier
                    Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics.[20] In a 1965
                    letter to his son
                    Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was
                    an upper-class
                    Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was not. <br><br>
                    I first
                    learned charity and
                    forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I
                    came, knowing more about
                    'Bloody Mary' than the Mother of Jesus—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship
                    by the
                    Romanists."[T 1] After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and
                    attended King
                    Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St Philip's School. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship
                    and returned to King
                    Edward's</p>



                <h1 class="tolkien-header">youth</h1>
                <p>While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, an
                    invention of his
                    cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their
                    interest in Animalic
                    soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex
                    language called Nevbosh.
                    The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation. Tolkien
                    learned
                    Esperanto some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed "The Book of the Foxrook", a
                    sixteen-page notebook,
                    where the "earliest example of one of his invented alphabets" appears. Short texts in this notebook
                    are written in
                    Esperanto. <br><br>

                    In 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey
                    Bache Smith, and
                    Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for
                    Tea Club and Barrovian
                    Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and,
                    secretly, in the school
                    library. After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a
                    council in London
                    at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing
                    poetry.<br><br>

                    In 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a
                    1968 letter,[T 2]
                    noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains ("including the glissade down the slithering
                    stones into the pine
                    woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from Interlaken to
                    Lauterbrunnen and on to camp
                    in the moraines beyond Mürren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the
                    view of the eternal
                    snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, "the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams". They went across the
                    Kleine Scheidegg to
                    Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass,
                    through the upper
                    Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.<br><br>

                    In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at Exeter College, Oxford. He initially read
                    classics but changed
                    his course in 1913 to English language and literature, graduating in 1915 with first-class honours.
                    Among his tutors
                    at Oxford was Joseph Wright, whose Primer of the Gothic Language had inspired Tolkien as a
                    schoolboy.</p>

                <h1 class="tolkien-header">Courtship and marriage</h1>
                <p>At the age of 16, Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his
                    brother Hilary moved
                    into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. According to Humphrey Carpenter,
                    "Edith and Ronald
                    took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the
                    pavement. There they would
                    sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl
                    was empty. ... With
                    two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were
                    orphans in need of
                    affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they
                    decided that they were
                    in love."<br><br>

                    His guardian, Father Morgan, considered it "altogether unfortunate"[T 3] that his surrogate son was
                    romantically
                    involved with an older, Protestant woman; Tolkien wrote that the combined tensions contributed to
                    his having "muffed
                    [his] exams".[T 3] Morgan prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with Edith
                    until he was 21.
                    Tolkien obeyed this prohibition to the letter, with one notable early exception, over which Father
                    Morgan threatened
                    to cut short his university career if he did not stop.<br><br>

                    On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H.
                    Jessop at
                    Cheltenham. He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry him. Edith
                    replied that she had
                    already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. But
                    Edith said she had
                    agreed to marry Field only because she felt "on the shelf" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still
                    cared for her. She
                    explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.<br><br>

                    On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith.
                    The two took a walk
                    into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had
                    agreed to accept
                    Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was "dreadfully upset
                    at first", and the
                    Field family was "insulted and angry".[34] Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her
                    guardian, "I have
                    nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the
                    extreme, and when he will
                    be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been
                    different."<br><br>

                    Following their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at
                    Tolkien's insistence.
                    Jessop, "like many others of his age and class ... strongly anti-Catholic", was infuriated, and he
                    ordered Edith to find
                    other lodgings.<br><br>

                    Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at
                    St Mary Immaculate
                    Catholic Church at Warwick, on 22 March 1916.In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed
                    admiration for his
                    wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood
                    of being killed in
                    the Great War</p>

                <h1 class="tolkien-header">Academic and writing career</h1>
                <p>On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant. His
                    first civilian
                    job after World War I was at the Oxford English Dictionary, where he worked mainly on the history
                    and etymology of words
                    of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W. In 1920, he took up a post as reader in English
                    language at the
                    University of Leeds, becoming the youngest member of the academic staff there. While at Leeds, he
                    produced A Middle
                    English Vocabulary and a definitive edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with E. V. Gordon;
                    both became academic
                    standard works for several decades. He translated Sir Gawain, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo. In 1925, he
                    returned to Oxford as
                    Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.<br><br>

                    In mid-1919, he began to tutor undergraduates privately, most importantly those of Lady Margaret
                    Hall and St Hugh's
                    College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years,
                    and Tolkien as a
                    married professor (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have
                    been.<br><br>

                    During his time at Pembroke College Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and the first two volumes of The Lord
                    of the Rings, while
                    living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford. He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the
                    name "Nodens",
                    following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire,
                    in 1928.</p>
