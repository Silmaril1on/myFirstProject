            <p>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a 2014 epic high fantasy adventure film directed by Peter
                Jackson from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, based on the
                1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. The sequel to 2013's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, it
                is the final instalment in The Hobbit trilogy, acting as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings
                trilogy. <br><br>

                The film's story concludes the adventure of Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield's company of dwarves,
                who take possession of the treasure beneath the Lonely Mountain as various factions clash over it, while
                Azog the Defiler and his forces make their move. <br><br>

                The film stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Luke Evans, Lee Pace,
                Benedict Cumberbatch, Ken Stott, Aidan Turner, Dean O'Gorman, Billy Connolly, Graham McTavish, James
                Nesbitt, Stephen Fry, and Ryan Gage. The ensemble cast also features Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm,
                Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, and Orlando Bloom. It was Holm's final film before his death in 2020, as
                well as Lee's final live-action role, although he would be featured as a voice actor in several films
                released after his death in 2015. <br><br>

                The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies premiered in London on 1 December 2014, and was then released
                on 11 December in New Zealand and on 17 December in the United States, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The
                film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $962.2 million worldwide, making it the second
                highest-grossing film of 2014. The film received numerous accolades; at the 87th Academy Awards, it was
                nominated for Best Sound Editing. <br><br>

                The Hobbit was originally planned as a two-part film, but Jackson confirmed plans for a third film on 30
                July 2012, turning his adaptation of The Hobbit into a trilogy. According to Jackson, the third film
                would contain the Battle of the Five Armies and make extensive use of the appendices that Tolkien wrote
                to expand the story of Middle-earth (published in the back of The Return of the King). Jackson also
                stated that while the third film would largely make use of footage originally shot for the first and
                second films, it would require additional filming as well. The third film was titled There and Back
                Again in August 2012. In April 2014, Jackson changed the title of the film to The Battle of the Five
                Armies as he thought the new title better suited the situation of the film. He stated that, had he
                adapted The Hobbit as a two-part film, the original title may have felt right for the second part which
                would have included both Bilbo's arrival in Erebor and departure, but after the decision to adapt the
                novel as a three-part film, it felt misplaced as Bilbo had already arrived at Erebor in the second part.
                Shaun Gunner, the chairman of The Tolkien Society, supported the decision: "The Battle of the Five
                Armies much better captures the focus of the film but also more accurately channels the essence of the
                story.

            <!-- PLOT -->

            <br>
            <h1 class="header">plot</h1><br> <br>

            <p>
                Bilbo and the Dwarves watch from the Lonely Mountain as the dragon Smaug sets Laketown ablaze. Bard
                breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the black arrow. Smaug's falling body crushes the
                Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat with the town's gold. Bard becomes the
                new leader of Laketown and guides its people to seek refuge in the ruins of Dale. Thorin, having become
                possessive of the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the Arkenstone, which Bilbo
                had previously found but kept hidden. Upon hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, he orders
                the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off. <br><br>

                Meanwhile, Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman arrive at Dol Guldur and free Gandalf, sending him to safety
                with Radagast. They battle and defeat the Nazgûl and then face a formless Sauron himself. Galadriel
                defeats him in a duel of wills and banishes him and his forces to the East. Azog, marching on Erebor
                with his vast Orc army, sends his son Bolg to Mount Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and
                Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats. <br><br>

                Thranduil and an Elf army arrive in Dale to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by the Dwarf king
                Thrór. Bard asks Thorin for the share of gold previously promised to the people of Laketown, but Thorin
                refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo
                sneaks the Arkenstone out of Erebor and hands it over to Thranduil and Bard, so that they can trade it
                for the promised treasures and prevent a battle. Thorin angrily refuses the proposal, while Bilbo chides
                him for letting greed cloud his judgement. Thorin nearly kills Bilbo but is stopped by Gandalf. Thorin's
                cousin Dáin arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men ensues, until
                Azog's army arrives. The forces of Dáin, Thranduil and Bard, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, immediately
                band together against the Orcs. A second front is opened when the Orcs attack Dale, forcing Bard to
                withdraw his forces to defend the city. <br><br>

                Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his
                company to join the battle. He rides with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog. Meanwhile, Tauriel and
                Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's arrival, and Bilbo volunteers to relay the news to Thorin,
                using his magic ring to move through the combat unseen. Azog kills Fíli as Bilbo and the other Dwarves
                are forced to watch. Bolg overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas
                battles Bolg and eventually kills him. The Great Eagles arrive with Radagast and Beorn, and the Orcs are
                finally defeated. In the climax, Thorin engages Azog in a duel and kills him, but is fatally wounded in
                the process. Bilbo makes peace with the dying Thorin, while Tauriel mourns Kili, with Thranduil
                acknowledging their love. Thranduil advises Legolas to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes
                by the name Strider. Thorin is buried with the Arkenstone along with Kili and Fili, and Dáin is crowned
                king. <br><br>

                As Thorin's company settles back into Erebor, and Dale begins to recover with Bard as the leader, Bilbo
                bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to the Shire with Gandalf. As the two
                part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him of
                it, although Bilbo assures him that he had lost the ring. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his
                belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He stops the sale and starts tidying up his
                home, revealing he still possesses the ring. Sixty years later,[a] Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf
                on his 111th birthday. <br><br>
