            <p>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a 2001 epic fantasy adventure film directed by Peter
                Jackson from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson, based on 1954's The Fellowship of
                the Ring, the first volume of the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first
                installment in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian
                McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic
                Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.

                Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains
                part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The
                fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the
                Ring) begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be
                destroyed.

                The Fellowship of the Ring was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed
                and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the
                trilogy. It premiered on 10 December 2001 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was then released
                on 19 December in the United States and on 20 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by critics
                and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film
                genre. It received praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, musical
                score, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed over $880 million worldwide in its initial
                release, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2001 and the fifth highest-grossing film of all
                time at the time of its release.[5] Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $897
                million.[4]

                Like its successors, The Fellowship of the Ring is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most
                influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 74th Academy Awards, it was
                nominated for thirteen awards, including Best Picture, winning for Best Cinematography, Best Makeup,
                Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects.

                In 2007, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history, being
                both the most recent film and the only film released in the 21st century to make it to the list. In
                2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library
                of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". <br><br>An ancient Ring
                thought lost for centuries has been found, and through a strange twist of fate has been given to a small
                Hobbit named Frodo. When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron,
                Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it. However, he does not go
                alone. He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and his three Hobbit
                friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains,
                facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the
                One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign.</p> <br><br>

                    In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power.
                    Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a
                    great
                    part of his power, to dominate the other Rings so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of
                    Men
                    and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring
                    with
                    it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the
                    Third
                    Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is
                    later
                    killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it
                    for
                    over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit
                    named
                    Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.
                    <br> <br>
                    Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend,
                    the
                    wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his
                    inheritance,
                    including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature,
                    and
                    learns that Gollum was captured and tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his
                    interrogation: "Shire" and "Baggins." Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo
                    departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard
                    Saruman, but discovers his alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazgûl servants
                    to
                    find Frodo.
                    <br> <br>
                    Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazgûl before
                    arriving
                    in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken
                    prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort
                    them
                    to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazgûl on Weathertop, and their leader, the
                    Witch-King,
                    stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues
                    Frodo,
                    summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazgûl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by
                    the
                    Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites
                    with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.
                    <br> <br>
                    Facing the threat of both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping
                    the
                    Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and
                    Gandalf,
                    that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the
                    Ring,
                    accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and
                    Strider—who
                    is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell,
                    gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of mithril.
                    <br><br>
                    The Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman's
                    spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that
                    forces
                    them to travel through the Mines of Moria. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship
                    is
                    attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin's Bane: a Balrog
                    residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a
                    vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship
                    reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can
                    complete the quest and that one of his friends in the Fellowship will try to take the Ring.
                    Meanwhile,
                    Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.
                    <br> <br>


                    The Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who
                    tries to take the Ring as Lady Galadriel had predicted. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship;
                    their leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as he fails to stop them from taking Merry and Pippin
                    as
                    prisoners. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help
                    the
                    people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to
                    travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after
                    him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way
                    down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor.
