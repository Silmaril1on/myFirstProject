            <p>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 epic fantasy adventure film directed by Peter
                Jackson from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson, based on 1955's The Return of the
                King, the third volume of the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The sequel to 2002's The
                Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the film is the final installment in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
                It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean
                Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Bernard Hill, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo
                Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, Karl Urban, John Noble, Andy Serkis, Ian Holm, and Sean Bean.
                <br><br>

                Continuing the plot of the previous film, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are making their final way toward Mount
                Doom in Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, unaware of Gollum's true intentions, while Merry,
                Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the rest are joining forces together against Sauron and his
                legions in Minas Tirith. <br><br>

                The Return of the King was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and
                edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy.
                It premiered on 1 December 2003 at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, and was then released on 17
                December 2003 in the United States and on 18 December 2003 in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by
                both critics and audiences, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and the fantasy film genre,
                with praise for the visual effects, performances, action sequences, direction, screenplay, musical
                score, costume design and emotional depth. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the
                highest-grossing film of 2003 and the second highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its
                release, as well as the highest-grossing film released by New Line Cinema. <br><br>

                Like the other films in the trilogy, The Return of the King is widely recognized as one of the greatest
                and most influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 76th Academy Awards,
                it won all eleven awards for which it was nominated, including Best Picture, tying with 1959's Ben-Hur
                and 1997's Titanic as the movie with the most Academy Award wins. It also became the second film series
                whose entries have all won Best Visual Effects, after the original Star Wars trilogy. <br><br>

                The final confrontation between the forces of good and evil fighting for control of the future of
                Middle-earth. Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the One Ring, while Aragorn leads the
                forces of good against Sauron's evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith.

            <h1 class="header">plot</h1><br> <br>

            <p>
                The hobbit Sméagol is fishing with his cousin Déagol, who discovers the One Ring in the river. Sméagol's
                mind is ensnared by the Ring, and he kills his cousin for it. Increasingly corrupted physically and
                mentally, he retreats into the Misty Mountains and becomes known as Gollum. <br><br>

                Centuries later, during the War of the Ring, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden of
                Rohan to Isengard, where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír, and
                the group returns to Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm's Deep.[a] Pippin looks into the
                palantír, seeing Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor's
                capital Minas Tirith; he rides there to warn Gondor's steward Denethor. Pippin, who accompanies him,
                swears fealty to Denethor, whose now-dead heir Boromir had saved his life;[b] on Gandalf's instruction,
                he triggers the lighting of the beacons, which call for help from Rohan. <br><br>

                Frodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now
                their guide, plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witness the Witch-king of
                Angmar, lord of the nine Nazgûl, setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum conspires to
                frame Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring; influenced by the growing power of the Ring,
                Frodo is taken in by the deception, and orders Sam to go home. Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing
                into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a
                chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyzes, and binds Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a
                returning Sam, who, mourning Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring. Sam realizes his mistake when a
                group of Orcs takes Frodo captive, but manages to rescue Frodo as the Orcs fight among themselves. Now
                inside Mordor, the hobbits continue towards Mount Doom, their destination. <br><br>

                As King Théoden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave
                Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, reforged from the shards of King Elendil's sword Narsil, and
                urges him to commit to claiming Gondor's throne, to which he is heir. Joined by Legolas and Gimli,
                Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead, and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should
                they come to Gondor's aid. Meanwhile, Faramir, who was earlier overwhelmed and driven back to Minas
                Tirith by the Witch-king, is gravely wounded in a suicide charge; believing his son to be dead, Denethor
                falls into madness. Gandalf marshals the defenders, but the huge Orc army breaks into the city. Denethor
                attempts to burn himself and Faramir on a pyre, but Pippin alerts Gandalf and they rescue Faramir.
                Denethor, set ablaze and in agony, jumps to his death. <br><br>

                Théoden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success against Orcs in the ensuing
                battle, they are decimated by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim and the Witch-king mortally wounds Théoden;
                however, his niece Éowyn slays the Witch-king with Merry's help. Théoden dies in his niece's arms.
                Aragorn then arrives with his Army of the Dead, who overcome Sauron's forces and win the battle. Their
                oath fulfilled, the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn decides to march on Mordor to distract
                Sauron from Frodo, now extremely weak, and Sam; all of Sauron's remaining forces march to meet Aragorn's
                diversion, allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom. Gollum, who survived his earlier fall, attacks
                them, but Frodo still manages to enter the mountain. There, he succumbs to the Ring's power, putting it
                on his finger, but Gollum manages to bite off his finger and reclaim it. They struggle together and both
                fall off the ledge. Frodo clings to it with one hand as remorse and guilt flood his mind in the wake of
                his succumbing to the ring, when Sam's unwavering faith and belief in his friend convinces him to make
                one final reach for Sam's hand, saving Frodo's life. Gollum falls and dies; the Ring, which fell with
                him, disintegrates in the lava. Mount Doom erupts as Sauron meets his demise, while Aragorn's army
                emerges victorious as its enemies fall into the earth after the ground collapses beneath them. <br><br>

                Gandalf rescues the hobbits with the help of eagles, and the surviving Fellowship is happily reunited in
                Minas Tirith. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and marries Arwen. The Hobbits return home to the Shire,
                where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. A few years later, Frodo who is still traumatised, departs Middle-earth
                for the Undying Lands with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the Red Book of
                Westmarch, which details their adventures. Sam returns to the Shire, where he embraces Rosie and their
                children.
